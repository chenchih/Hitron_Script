   ```
  - IPv6 regualr expression
   ```
   matchObj = re.match(r'.*'+ info + '(.*)\n',value, re.M|re.DOTALL)
   ```
  - python3 used byte, so need to decode it, else will have problem 
    Chinese Window need to encode t big5, else will have problem
    - decode("big5") due to ping (OS: Chinese Window)
      ```
      stdout = process.stdout.read()
      stdout=stdout.decode("big5")
       ```
     - decode("utf8") to convert byte to str
